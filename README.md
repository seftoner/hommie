# Hommie - Flutter Client for HomeAssistant
Welcome to Hommie! This project is all about crafting a stunning and user-friendly app for Home Assistant (HA) using Dart and Flutter. We chat with your Home Assistant via WebSocket API.

## Why Hommie?
Why not? We want a gorgeous, easy-to-use client for Home Assistant that works everywhere. Plus, it's a fun way to practice coding and dive into new tech!

## Cool Features
We're just getting started, but here's what's cooking:
- **Authentication**: Secure login and logout. Tested on local networks.
  - Server Discovery: Finds Home Assistant servers on your local network and lists them for easy pickings.
- **Areas**: Browse through different areas.
- **Companion App**: (In Progress) Register the app on Home Assistant and send location and sensor data.
- **Logs**: View and export app logs.
